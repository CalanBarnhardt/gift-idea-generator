# Welcome to the gift-idea-generator

DO NOT TOUCH THE GITIGNORE unless you are adding something to it, i don't want your node_modules

to run this project you will need the following: Node.js, yarn and vite 
to get node.js follow this link https://nodejs.org/en you should be able to just download and keep hitting next
run node -v to make sure it installed properly
it should also give you access to npm, if it doesn't follow this link https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
from there all you need to do is run npm install -g yarn
and npm install vite

then you should be able to cd into the gift-idea-generator/frontend-gift-idea-generator and hit a yarn run dev, then go to the link

if you get errors, you likely need to install tailwind although i was able to do it on a second computer without needing to install this

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
